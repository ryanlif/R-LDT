# Robust Latent Decision Threshold (R-LDT) model

## Data
* The synthetic data folder contains the three toy examples for the first experiment (synthetic case).
* The simulated data used in simulated studies can be generated by ```simulation.R```.

## Code
### Synthetic case
Run ```rldt.R``` to test the three toy examples in the folder of synthetic data.
For comparison with LDT, please run ```ldt.R``` and see the output.

### Simulation 
For simulation studies, please run ```experiment.R``` and see the output. For the details, please see the comments in the code.

## Citation
Please consider citing our paper if you find the code useful for your work.
